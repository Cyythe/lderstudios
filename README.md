## Motivation                                                            
The idea for creating a game development website was born out of my imagining myself as the owner of a video game company.  Becoming a graphic designer or a game programmer was my childhood dream when I first began to program at age 11.  This project was my opportunity to visualize what my company's website might look like.  This site is my second web-based project.
