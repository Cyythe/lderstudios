			<h2>The Good Old Days</h2>
			
			<p>Can you recall playing a game that, at its conclusion, left you with a 'Wow, great game' 
			moment?  We do.  Most of the really great games of the past were crafted by teams facing the
			limits of their current technology.  They were forced to push the boundaries of game development
			by balancing hardware performance, interesting characters, and challenging content.  Many hardcore
			gamers have cited that the recent generations of games are missing something.  While there have been
			a few great titles that have left us with that 'wow' moment, many games leave the player indifferent 
			or even resentful about the hard earned dollars and many hours they invested.  It is time for a return 
			to the golden era of gaming.  Come with us on our journey. A journey back to the L-Der ways.</p>

			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		
			<p>Here at L-Der Studios we focus on reinventing what is means to make a 'great game'.  Everyone from
			our developers all the way to our writers believe that, if the player is not left with that 'wow' moment, 
			we have failed.  Our name 'L-Der' is a play on the word 'elder'.  In many cultures, an elder is someone 
			that possesses deep experience, a wide breadth of knowledge, and the wisdom of how to apply both.  With 
			several decades of combined knowledge and a deep passion to make nothing less than the best games, 
			L-Der Studios will guide the game industry back from the brink of destruction and have a blast while 
			we do it!</p>

			<h3>Houston Studio</h3>
			
			<p>Opened in 2015, our Houston, Texas studio was where our commitment to make great began.  The good people
			of the city welcomed us with open arms and have provided us with some of the best talent in the game industry.</p>

			<h3>***NEW*** California Studio</h3>
			
			<p>We have expanded!  In January 2017, L-Der Studios opened a second location in Los Angeles, California.  
			California sports some of the best schools in digital art, animation, and game development.  With that in 
			mind, we decided to infiltrate the market like an RPG character in stealth mode. Shuussh! Our competition may hear you.</p>
