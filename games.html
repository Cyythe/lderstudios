			<h2>Grymwar: Online</h2>
			
			<p>For many centuries, the world of Grymwar has been in constant turmoil caused by seven deities that each 
			vie for control.  Kingdoms rise and fall, cataclysmic events occur with ever increasing frequency, and common 
			people suffer as their lands are ravaged by famine, greed, war, and magic.  To tip the scales in their favor, 
			each deity seeks to find champions to rally the lands and bring their agenda to bear.  The choices and actions 
			of each champion will impact the world on a scale so grand that it is incomprehensible.  How drastically will 
			they change the world of Grymwar?  Only time will tell.</p>
			
			<h3>Global Impact</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Choices cumulatively impact the world wide influence of each deity as you play.  Players can gain great 
				favor or displeasure from deities as they wax or wane in power.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Play as You Want</h3>

				<li>Grymwar: Online lets players create their characters how they want.  With no class system, a player can 
				choose to become a great warrior, a cunning politician, or even a deadly assassin.  Choose skills that cater 
				to your play style and change the world how you see fit.</li>

			<h2>RITE</h2>
			
			<p>A priest, sent to a small town to perform the rite of exorcism, soon discovers that what 
			is 'right' is a matter of perspective.  Playing as Father Salvatore and armed with only the horrific truths disclosed by an 
			evil spirit, you must unravel mysteries that have been closely guarded by his 
			organization for untold years.  Who can you trust? How will you know the truth?</p>
